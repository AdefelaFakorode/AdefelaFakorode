### Hi there, I'm Adefela! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>


I recently graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the [City University of New York, College of Staten Island](https://www.csi.cuny.edu/). My passion lies in the exciting realms of UI/UX design and full-stack development, where I can incorporate problem-solving, creativity, and design into an application itself.

Outside of coding, I create and share lifestyle content, vlogging my journey through self-development and life as a software engineer. I also enjoy live-streaming gaming sessions on Twitch with friends and connecting with others through shared passions.
